# Project Ideas

:warning: **NOTE**: Use [effective problem-solving techniques](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Learning_and_getting_help#effective_problem-solving) to break larger projects down into smaller tasks.

----

Your app should have:

- Database interaction (store/retrieve data).
- login system with different levels, e.g. blog
author, login to comment/review, or guest login. This depends on the app and using case.
- Intuitive, well built user interface (UI). In other
words, a nice front-end side of the web app. It
does hurt the webapp if the back-end provides
great functionality while the user interface is
rubbish!! You can use a template if you want.

* GitHub Pages site:
  + Hosts front-end projects, and the front-end of full-stack projects.
  + The backend of full-stack projects is hosted on some free service and
    accessed via an API
  + Frontend makes API requests to the hosted backend, so it looks like the
    site has a backend.
  + Make a web interface to try out CLI programs:
    - Someone must have done it before (xterm.js?)
    - Make an API for the CLI which returns an object with `stdOut`, `stdErr`
      and `exitCode` properties
    - The front-end just simluates a terminal, but with only the CLI program
      available (and maybe an `ls` command if there are files available)

* Build front-ends for a few public api's before trying to make your own api.
  + See https://github.com/public-apis

  + python or node
  + in the browser
  + in the terminal
