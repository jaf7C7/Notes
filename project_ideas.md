* GitHub Pages site:
  + Hosts front-end projects, and the front-end of full-stack projects.
  + The backend of full-stack projects is hosted on some free service and
    accessed via an API
  + Frontend makes API requests to the hosted backend, so it looks like the
    site has a backend.
  + Make a web interface to try out CLI programs:
    - Make an API for the CLI which returns an object with `stdOut`, `stdErr`
      and `exitCode` properties
    - The front-end just simluates a terminal, but with only the CLI program
      available (and maybe an `ls` command if there are files available)
