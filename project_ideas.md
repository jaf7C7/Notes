* GitHub Pages site:
  + Very simple index page with list of web projects
  + Backend API of projects hosted on some free service
  + Frontend makes API requests to the hosted backend, so it looks like the site has a backend.
  + Make a web interface to try out CLI programs:
    - Make an API for the CLI which returns an object with `stdOut`, `stdErr` and `exitCode` properties
    - The front-end just simluates a terminal, but with only the CLI program available (and maybe an `ls` command if there are files available)
